This is The Repository for My Second assignment  so to anyone that isn't my professor, sorry if this isn't the best

# Description
This project implements direct number system mappings and signed number representations in C, building on the base conversion framework from Assignment 1. The tools are designed for Owl Techâ€™s CPU design team to analyze how different architectures represent values in binary.

# Build Instructions
To compile and run the program, use the GCC compiler on your system:

Compiles the program - `gcc -o convert convert.c main.c`

Run's the program - `./convert`
